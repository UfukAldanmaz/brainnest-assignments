                <p>Romanian filmmaker Corneliu Porumboiu, winner of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival Camera d’Or has made
                    one of the most original and intelligent comedies of
                    recent years, 12:08 East of Bucharest. Convinced that "historical truth does not exist", he has
                    created an ironic and biting portrait of contemporary Romania through the memories of that December
                    22 of 1989.</p>
