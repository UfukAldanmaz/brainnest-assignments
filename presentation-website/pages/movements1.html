                <p>Shōhei Imamura was a Japanese film director.
                    His main interest as a filmmaker lay in the depiction of the lower strata of Japanese society.
                    A key figure in the Japanese New Wave, who continued working into the 21st century, Imamura is the
                    only director from Japan to win two Palme d'Or awards.</p>

                <p>Nagisa Oshima's career extends from the initiation of the "Nuberu bagu" (New Wave) movement in
                    Japanese cinema in the late 1950s and early 1960s, to the contemporary use of cinema and television
                    to express paradoxes in modern society. </p>
