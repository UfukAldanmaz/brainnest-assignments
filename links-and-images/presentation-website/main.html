            <h2>Films of Japanese New Wave</h2>
            <img style="width: 550px;" src="images/japanese-new-wave-1.jpeg" alt="japanese">
            <p><em>The Japanese New Wave</em> is a group of loosely-connected Japanese filmmakers during the late 1950s
                and into
                the 1970s. Although they did not make up a coherent movement, these artists shared a rejection of
                traditions and conventions of classical Japanese cinema in favor of more challenging works, both
                thematically and formally. Coming to the fore in a time of national social change and unrest, the films
                made in this wave dealt with taboo subject matter, including sexual violence, radicalism, youth culture
                and deliquency, Korean discrimination, queerness, and the aftermath of World War II. They also adopted
                more unorthodox and experimental approaches to composition, editing and narrative.</p>

            <h2>Films of Romanian New Wave</h2>
            <img style="width: 550px;" src="images/romanian-new-wave-1.jpg" alt="romanian">
            <p><em>The Romanian New Wave</em> is a movement in Romanian cinema known for its expressive cinematography
                and the
                thematic focus on the effects of communism on the Romanian everyman. </p>
            <p>The Romanian New Wave began with four films released between 2004 and 2005.
                The Romanian New Wave is a genre of realist and often minimalist films made in Romania since the
                mid-aughts, starting with two award-winning shorts by two Romanian directors, Catalin Mitulescu and
                Cristi Puiu. This was followed up by 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days by Cristian Mungiu which received
                significant
                international attention.
            </p>
            <p>Romanian New Wave filmmakers have continued to make films that are realistic and minimally stylized
                while addressing matters of social crisis and political change in Romania.</p>

            <h2>Films of Czechoslovak New Wave</h2>
            <img style="width: 550px;" src="images/czech-new-wave.jpeg" alt="czech">
            <p><em>The Czechoslovak New Wave</em> was a movement in cinema beginning in 1963 and lasting until the end
                of the
                Prague Spring reforms of 1968. Led by students of the Film and Television School of the Academy of the
                Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), the arrival of this new wave of cinema came about largely as a result
                of new directions in the arts generally and the pressure for social and political reform that developed
                both inside and outside of the Communist Party in the 1960s – a collective pressure that led to the
                abolition of censorship and the movement towards increased democratisation.</p>
